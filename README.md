# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction


## Overview

This project focuses on addressing the challenges of imbalanced datasets in classification. The classification models were compared based on the F1 score, achieving a maximum score of 0.96 on the Random Forest algorithm. Various techniques, including random under-sampling, bagging, and boosting, were employed to overcome the problems of imbalance and skewness in the dataset.

## Project Highlights

1. **Model Comparison based on F1 Score:**
   - Compared classification models with a focus on the F1 score.
   - Achieved a maximum F1 score of 0.96 on the Random Forest algorithm.

2. **Handling Imbalance using Sampling Techniques:**
   - Employed random under-sampling to address the imbalance in the dataset.
   - Utilized bagging and boosting techniques to enhance model performance in skewed datasets.

## Steps

### 1. Model Comparison based on F1 Score

- Compared the performance of classification models with a focus on the F1 score.
- Identified the Random Forest algorithm as the top-performing model with a maximum F1 score of 0.96.

### 2. Handling Imbalance using Sampling Techniques

- Implemented random under-sampling to balance the class distribution.
- Utilized bagging techniques (e.g., Bootstrap Aggregating) and boosting techniques (e.g., AdaBoost) to overcome dataset skewness.

## Results

- Achieved a maximum F1 score of 0.96 on the Random Forest algorithm.
- Successfully addressed the imbalance in the dataset using random under-sampling, bagging, and boosting techniques.
